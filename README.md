Open in Xcode 9 (currently beta) and run. You may need to set your team for the target for signing.

After that it's fairly self explanatory.

<img src="screenshot1.png" width="375" height="667" />
<img src="screenshot2.png" width="375" height="667" />
<img src="screenshot3.png" width="375" height="667" />

You can change the height/width of the grid:

    let cGridWidth = 8
    let cGridHeight = 12

Also the speed:

    var baseDescentTime = 0.7
